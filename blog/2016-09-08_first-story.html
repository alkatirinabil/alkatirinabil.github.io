		<h2> Step One: Gather Information </h2>
		<p> Before you make any decision, you need to gather all valuable information. For example, when it came to choosing a seat on my Southwest flight, I needed to know whether the flight was full or not. This bit of information would allow me to decide whether to take a seat where I might be stuck in the middle or take a seat on the aisle. The best strategy depended on how many people would eventually get on the plane. So, I asked the stewardess and she said the plane would be pretty full. In your business, this fact-finding stage can take weeks, days, or just minutes... The key here is to gather the information and then move on to the next step...</p>

		<h2> Step Two: Interpret the Facts </h2>
		<p> Now that you have the facts you need it is time to interpret them so you can make your decision. In the case of the airline seat, the interpretation was easy, I could not count on having the seat next to me empty so I chose my seat accordingly. The pitfall with business decisions is that sometimes we let our decision making be clouded by doubt and fear. Do not let those emotions in. Make your decision based on the facts as you see them. </p>

		<h2> Step Three: Look at the Options and Decide. </h2>
		<p> You have looked at the options, now it is time to stretch your imagination and see what choices you really have. Now is the time to make a decision. If you have done steps 1 and 2. you should know the right choice. Make it and start implementing. </p>
