		<p> The <a href= "http://theweek.com/speedreads/647399/apple-announces-iphone-7"> new iPhone 7 features </a> caused a lot of excitement during Apple's announcement event Wednesday but Apple co-founder Steve Jobs might not have been so pleased with the progress. One of the day's most buzzed-about reveals involved the new iPhone model doing away with the traditional headphone jack, forcing users to either use headphones with a Lightning-friendly cable, or go totally wireless.</p>

		<p> It's exactly those wireless ear buds, however, that Jobs might have taken issue with. "Steve Jobs once argued with me about doing wireless earbuds," The Verge's Walt Mossberg <a href="https://live.theverge.com/apple-iphone-7-launch-event-live-blog/?_ga=1.251965260.410718701.1453731578"> recalled</a>. "'You want yet another thing to charge?' he said."</p>
		<p> Mossberg added that Apple's new wireless headphones, or "AirPods," which run $159, will indeed be annoying to charge. "Five hours of battery life between charges on the new AirPods won't likely get you through a cross country flight," <a href="https://live.theverge.com/apple-iphone-7-launch-event-live-blog/?_ga=1.251965260.410718701.1453731578">he pointed out</a>.</p>
		<p> Apple's other co-founder, Steve Wozniak, has also frowned upon the company's decision to make such a change to the new iPhone. "If it's missing the 3.5mm earphone jack, that's going to tick off a lot of people," Wozniak told the <a href="http://www.afr.com/technology/mobiles-and-tablets/apple/steve-wozniak-says-apple-must-fix-iphone-7-bluetooth-or-revive-its-headphone-jack-20160821-gqxwsg#ixzz4I6wk11Ub"> Australian Financial Review </a> in August.</p>
		<p> The new iPhone will reportedly come with an adapter that will allow traditional earphones to plug into the new Lightning jack hopefully a happy compromise for everyone. Jeva Lange</p>
